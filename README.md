## Description
#### This repository is where I created a workout tracker. The users would be able to view, create, and track their daily workouts. View which will display all of the exercises and the stats charts. Create exercises by selecting one of the two types of exercises (resistance or cardio) and then fill in the requirements detail for the exercise (name of the exercise, weight, sets, reps, and duration). If the exercise is a cardio exercise, the users would also be able to track their distance traveled.
